# snake-pygame
A game of Snake made using Python and the Pygame module.

Most of the code was done by me, but there are lines which I had to look up from the tutorial I was following.
The lambda and filter() functions are still relatively unknown to me, so I will try to understand them so I could incorporate them in my future projects.

The game is pretty much finished. Maybe in the future I will a different randition of this game.
